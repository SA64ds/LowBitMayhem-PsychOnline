Note: Most of these are just things removed

- Bit-Beat -
* All the SMB1 stuff was removed to work better with skins
* Every script relevant to the style change was removed
(The fonts are still there, just because)
* The code to take you to SORETRO (SA64 Cover) was removed

- SORETRO (SA64 Cover) -
* SORETRO (SA64 Cover) is now accessible in Freeplay
* Icon for SORETRO Mario was added, for the reason above (and since you can't hide the health bar in Psych Online)
(Icon by Cloak2300, with some edits by me)

- Misc. -
* Settings were removed (since Psych Online doesn't support them)
* Every script related to the settings, including for stickers, was removed
* Now-unused assets were removed to save on file space
* Lore folder was removed for the same reason as above
* The inverted color health and time bars were removed
* SA64 is usable as a skin online (using some of the alts to make up for a lack of poses)
